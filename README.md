your files on your tiptoi

---

With totem, you can build your own audio books to use with your tiptoi. No account or credit card required, no cloud either. Everything stays on your computer.

You need two things for this to work:

1. An audio book file you put on your tiptoi

2. A printout, which contains the visual codes the tiptoi uses to actually play the audio

Totem will help you get both.

## Audio book file

First, choose some audio files. These can be mp3 files of your favorite children's songs or can be recordings made by you. (Support for ogg files coming soon). These files will stay on your computer, nothing is really "uploaded" anywhere. You can choose files using the "choose audio" button, or you can simply drag-n-drop files from your desktop.

You can edit the album and song title as well as the artist directly in the table after a double-click on the respective field. Changes are saved instantly. (Item reordering coming soon).

Finally, save the audio book file directly to your tiptoi (usually, the pen is recognized as a storage media, just like a USB stick).

## Print

Configure a print layout. Right now you can choose from three layouts with a few customization options. (More customization soon). Then, hit the print button and make sure that the print options do not scale or skew the image in any way. Use a printer that manages 1200dpi (a very good 600dpi printer might also work).

## Prior art

All credit for the heavy lifting goes to [tttool](https://github.com/entropia/tip-toi-reveng). I'm really only translating all the low-level stuff and adding a few sprinkles on top.

## Why totem

With all due respect to tttool and the authors, the project is not very accessible to non-technical people. There are other endeavors to provide a graphical user interface for tttool, but they too are a bit limited in terms of ease of use.

Designing totem, I set the following constraints:

• I don't want to pay for hosting or storage

• I don't want to handle user data

• No installation required

Using modern web technologies, it's possible to satisfy all of the above.

## How does it work
